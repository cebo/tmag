						<h1>Tale Magazine </h1>
						<h3>Storytellers inspire storytelling</h3>

					</div>

					<div class="twocol">


						<p>Story is one of the most influential and inspirational forces in our lives. A good story changes the way we see our world and stirs our imaginations to create new ones. Tale exists because we believe the best stories are told and retold in different ways, on different canvases, and by different voices. And each new Tale inspires the next.</p>
						
						<p>Tale Magazine is a quarterly printed magazine of fictional shorts, rich in character and place, that inspire and challenge readers across multiple genres. Each story will inspire or be inspired by photography sourced from Instagram and direct submissions, providing not just a unique visual expression for that story, but an artistic direction for our filmmakers to produce a short film.</p>

						<p>Tale’s newest edition is now open for short story and photography submissions to be printed and distributed internationally. So, if you have stories you’ve written or want to write, or if you have photos just waiting to inspire someone, submit your work today.</p>
